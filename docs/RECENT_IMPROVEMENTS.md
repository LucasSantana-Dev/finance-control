# Recent Improvements and Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the recent improvements and fixes made to the Finance Control application, focusing on stability, quality, and developer experience enhancements.

## üöÄ Major Improvements

### 1. MapStruct Integration

**What**: Implemented MapStruct 1.5.5.Final for type-safe DTO-entity mapping.

**Benefits**:
- Compile-time validation of mappings
- No reflection overhead at runtime
- Better IDE support and debugging
- Eliminates boilerplate mapping code

**Implementation**:
- Added MapStruct dependencies to `build.gradle`
- Created mappers for all entities: `FinancialGoalMapper`, `TransactionMapper`, `TransactionResponsiblesMapper`, `UserMapper`
- Integrated with Spring's dependency injection system

**Files Changed**:
- `build.gradle` - Added MapStruct dependencies
- `src/main/java/com/finance_control/*/mapper/*.java` - New mapper interfaces

### 2. JPA Auditing Configuration

**What**: Added automatic timestamp management for all entities.

**Benefits**:
- Automatic `createdAt` and `updatedAt` field population
- Consistent audit trail across all entities
- Reduced boilerplate code in entity classes

**Implementation**:
- Created `JpaConfig` class with `@EnableJpaAuditing`
- Configured JPA repositories base package scanning
- All entities extending `BaseModel` now have automatic timestamp management

**Files Changed**:
- `src/main/java/com/finance_control/shared/config/JpaConfig.java` - New configuration class

### 3. Enhanced Testing Infrastructure

**What**: Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage.

**Benefits**:
- 80% minimum test coverage requirement
- Unit tests for all service layers
- Integration tests with TestContainers
- Better test isolation and reliability

**Implementation**:
- Added unit tests for Auth, Goals, Transactions, and Users
- Created integration tests with real PostgreSQL database
- Enhanced test utilities and base classes

**Files Changed**:
- `src/test/java/com/finance_control/unit/**/*.java` - Unit tests
- `src/test/java/com/finance_control/integration/**/*.java` - Integration tests

## üîß Critical Fixes

### 1. Optimistic Locking Issues

**Problem**: `ObjectOptimisticLockingFailureException` in integration tests.

**Root Cause**: Hardcoded entity IDs in test setup causing version conflicts with JPA's optimistic locking mechanism.

**Solution**:
- Removed hardcoded User IDs from `TransactionSourceEntityRepositoryIntegrationTest`
- Let JPA generate IDs automatically to avoid version conflicts
- Improved test isolation and reliability

**Files Changed**:
- `src/test/java/com/finance_control/integration/transactions/repository/TransactionSourceEntityRepositoryIntegrationTest.java`

**Impact**: All integration tests now pass consistently without optimistic locking failures.

### 2. Docker Compatibility Issues

**Problem**: Scripts failing on macOS due to missing `timeout` command and Docker Compose v2 syntax.

**Root Cause**: 
- `timeout` command not available on macOS by default
- Scripts using `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose` (v2 syntax)

**Solution**:
- Added `gtimeout` fallback for macOS compatibility
- Updated all scripts to use `docker compose` (v2 syntax)
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic

**Files Changed**:
- `scripts/dev.sh` - Enhanced with macOS compatibility
- `scripts/modules/build.sh` - Fixed timeout and docker-compose commands
- `scripts/modules/services.sh` - Updated Docker Compose syntax
- `scripts/modules/sonarqube.sh` - Updated Docker Compose syntax
- `scripts/modules/devshell.sh` - Updated Docker Compose syntax

**Impact**: All development scripts now work consistently across macOS and Linux.

### 3. Quality Check Violations

**Problem**: Checkstyle, PMD, and SpotBugs violations preventing build success.

**Root Cause**: Unused imports and variables in test files.

**Solution**:
- Removed unused imports from all test files
- Fixed unused variables and parameters
- Ensured all code quality checks pass

**Files Changed**:
- Multiple test files with unused import cleanup
- `src/main/java/com/finance_control/transactions/mapper/TransactionMapper.java`

**Impact**: All quality checks now pass consistently, ensuring code quality standards.

### 4. Database Migration Issues

**Problem**: Missing `updated_at` column in `transaction_responsibilities` table.

**Root Cause**: Database schema not aligned with entity inheritance structure.

**Solution**:
- Created new migration `V4__add_updated_at_to_transaction_responsibilities.sql`
- Removed unnecessary SonarQube database migration (runs in separate container)
- Aligned database schema with BaseModel entity structure

**Files Changed**:
- `src/main/resources/db/migration/V4__add_updated_at_to_transaction_responsibilities.sql` - New migration
- Removed `src/main/resources/db/migration/V4__create_sonarqube_database.sql`

**Impact**: Database schema now properly supports JPA auditing for all entities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Experience Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Development Scripts

**What**: Improved `dev.sh` script with better error handling and retry logic.

**Features**:
- Retry mechanism for Docker operations
- Better timeout handling for tests and quality checks
- Enhanced error messages and troubleshooting tips
- Improved `--no-test` flag support across all commands

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run quality checks with retry logic
./scripts/dev.sh quality

# Run quality checks without tests (faster)
./scripts/dev.sh quality --no-test

# Run tests with enhanced error handling
./scripts/dev.sh test
```

### 2. Docker Build Process Improvements

**What**: Enhanced Docker build process with better environment variable handling.

**Features**:
- Added `SKIP_TESTS` build argument support
- Improved Docker Compose v2 compatibility
- Better build argument passing to all services

**Implementation**:
- Updated `Dockerfile` to accept `SKIP_TESTS` as build argument
- Modified `docker-compose.yml` to pass build arguments to all services
- Enhanced build process for different environments

### 3. Code Quality Gates

**What**: All code quality checks now pass consistently.

**Tools**:
- **Checkstyle**: Code style validation
- **PMD**: Static code analysis
- **SpotBugs**: Bug detection
- **SonarQube**: Comprehensive code quality analysis

**Results**:
- Zero violations in all quality checks
- Consistent code quality across the project
- Automated quality gates in CI/CD pipeline
