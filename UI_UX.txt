PROJECT OVERVIEW & DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

DESIGN A COMPREHENSIVE PERSONAL FINANCE MANAGEMENT WEB APPLICATION FOR BRAZILIAN USERS

================================================================================
SKY BLUE COLOR PALETTE - COMPLETE SYSTEM
================================================================================

PRIMARY BRAND COLOR: SKY BLUE
------------------------------
Sky blue represents trust, stability, growth, and financial prosperity. It's calming yet energetic, professional yet approachable. This color should feel like looking at a clear Brazilian sky - optimistic and clear.

Primary Sky Blue: #0EA5E9

NEUTRAL FOUNDATION COLORS
-------------------------
These provide structure and hierarchy:

Light Mode Neutrals:
- Pure White (#FFFFFF): Main content areas, cards, backgrounds - feels clean and spacious
- Slate 50 (#F8FAFC): Subtle section backgrounds - gentle separation without harsh lines
- Slate 100 (#F1F5F9): Nested backgrounds - deeper separation when needed
- Slate 200 (#E2E8F0): Borders - soft, unobtrusive, clearly defines areas
- Slate 500 (#64748B): Secondary text - readable but clearly less important
- Slate 800 (#1E293B): Primary text - strong, readable, professional

Dark Mode Neutrals:
- Slate 900 (#0F172A): Main background - deep, comfortable for extended viewing
- Slate 800 (#1E293B): Card backgrounds - elevated, clearly defined
- Slate 700 (#334155): Borders - visible but subtle
- Slate 50 (#F8FAFC): Primary text - bright, comfortable to read
- Slate 300 (#CBD5E1): Secondary text - softer, less emphasis

TEXT HIERARCHY COLORS
---------------------
Light Mode:
- Primary Text (#1E293B): Main content, important information - bold, confident
- Secondary Text (#64748B): Supporting information, metadata - softer, contextual
- Tertiary Text (#94A3B8): Placeholders, disabled states - clearly inactive
- Inverse Text (#FFFFFF): On dark backgrounds - crisp, high contrast

Dark Mode:
- Primary Text (#F8FAFC): Main content - bright, easy to read
- Secondary Text (#CBD5E1): Supporting information - comfortable contrast
- Tertiary Text (#94A3B8): Placeholders - same in both modes for consistency

================================================================================
TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM - READING EXPERIENCE
================================================================================

FONT CHOICE: INTER
------------------
Inter is chosen for its excellent readability at all sizes, modern feel, and perfect support for Portuguese characters (á, é, í, ó, ú, ã, õ, ç). It feels professional yet friendly, technical yet approachable. It's the voice of the application - clear, confident, helpful.

TYPEFACE PERSONALITY
---------------------
- Display Sizes (48px, 40px): Bold statements, hero moments - "Here's your financial snapshot"
- Headings (32px, 28px, 24px): Section leaders - "These are your transactions"
- Body (16px, 14px): Conversation text - "Here's what this means"
- Small Text (12px, 11px): Whispered details - "Updated 2 minutes ago"

READING RHYTHM
--------------
Generous line height (1.5) makes Portuguese text comfortable to read. Slightly tighter line height (1.2-1.3) for headings creates visual cohesion. Letter spacing is natural for readability, with slight negative tracking (-0.01em to -0.02em) on large headings for modern feel.

CURRENCY & NUMBERS
------------------
Numbers and currency use monospace fonts for alignment and quick scanning. When users see "R$ 1.234,56" next to "R$ 15.230,50", digits align perfectly, making comparison instant and effortless. This builds trust through visual precision.

================================================================================
SPACING & LAYOUT PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

BREATHING ROOM
--------------
The interface should breathe. Generous spacing makes information digestible. Cards have comfortable padding so content doesn't feel cramped. Sections are separated clearly so users can focus on one thing at a time.

RESPONSIVE GRACE
----------------
On desktop, information spreads elegantly across the screen - users see overview and detail simultaneously. On tablet, it reorganizes into a comfortable 2-column layout. On mobile, it stacks vertically but never feels cramped - every element has space to be touched and understood.

GRID SYSTEM
-----------
A flexible grid system that adapts beautifully:
- Desktop: Multi-column layouts showcase relationships (charts side-by-side, summary cards in rows)
- Tablet: 2-column layouts maintain visual balance
- Mobile: Single column, full width for focused attention

The grid guides the eye naturally: most important information top-left, supporting details flow naturally down and right.

================================================================================
COMPONENT PHILOSOPHY - USER INTERACTIONS
================================================================================

BUTTONS: CLEAR CALLS TO ACTION
------------------------------
Primary buttons feel substantial and trustworthy - they're the main actions users take. Sky blue with white text feels confident and inviting. When hovered, they slightly lift (shadow deepens) and brighten slightly, giving tactile feedback even on non-touch screens.

Secondary buttons are more subtle - outlined in sky blue, they're available but not pushy. Perfect for alternative actions like "Cancel" or "Save as Draft."

Danger buttons (delete, destructive actions) use red sparingly - they demand attention because the action is significant. Always accompanied by confirmation.

INPUTS: GUIDED ENTRY
--------------------
Input fields feel welcoming and helpful. They're clearly defined with soft borders, and when focused, they glow with sky blue - like the system is paying attention, ready to help. Placeholder text is friendly and instructive: "Ex: Almoço no restaurante" rather than just "Description."

Error states are helpful, not scolding. Red borders appear with a helpful message below: "Este campo é obrigatório" or "Por favor, insira uma data válida." Success states subtly confirm: green border and checkmark when valid.

CARDS: INFORMATION CONTAINERS
-----------------------------
Cards elevate content above the background, giving it importance. They have soft shadows that feel elegant, not heavy. When clickable, they respond to hover with a subtle lift - users know they can interact. Content inside is well-organized with clear hierarchy.

MODALS: FOCUSED CONVERSATIONS
------------------------------
Modals appear gracefully, dimming the background to focus attention on the task at hand. They feel like a conversation - clear title, organized content, obvious actions. Closing feels natural - X button, ESC key, or clicking outside (with confirmation if unsaved changes).

================================================================================
SCREEN 1: FINANCIAL DASHBOARD OVERVIEW
================================================================================

USER EXPERIENCE VISION
----------------------
When users open the dashboard, they immediately see their financial health at a glance. It's like opening a personalized financial report that's beautiful, informative, and actionable. The page feels welcoming yet professional, comprehensive yet digestible.

VISUAL HIERARCHY - WHAT USERS NOTICE FIRST
-------------------------------------------
1. Personal greeting with their name - creates connection
2. Five summary cards showing key numbers - the financial pulse
3. Interactive charts showing trends - the story over time
4. Goal progress table - what they're working toward
5. Quick stats - their activity at a glance

The eye flows naturally: greeting → summary cards → charts → goals → stats

PAGE LAYOUT STRUCTURE
---------------------
The page has a clean, organized structure. At the top, a welcoming header greets the user by name and shows their profile access. Below that, five elegant summary cards display the most important financial metrics in an easy-to-scan grid.

Charts section presents two beautiful visualizations side-by-side that tell the story of income, expenses, and spending patterns. These aren't static images - they're interactive, allowing users to explore their data.

A goal progress table shows active goals with visual progress indicators that make completion feel achievable. Finally, quick action cards provide shortcuts to detailed views.

HEADER SECTION - PERSONAL WELCOME
----------------------------------
The header feels personal and welcoming. On the left, a friendly greeting "Olá, [User Name]" appears in a comfortable, readable size. The user's name is slightly emphasized to feel personalized. Next to this, subtle navigation hints show where they are in the application.

On the right, notification and profile access feel accessible but unobtrusive. The profile avatar is circular with a sky blue border when active, creating a visual connection to the brand.

Summary cards row creates an impressive financial overview at a glance. Each card is substantial enough to feel important but compact enough to see all five together. They're arranged in a responsive grid that adapts beautifully: five across on large screens, reorganizing gracefully on smaller devices.

SUMMARY CARD 1: TOTAL INCOME
-----------------------------
This card celebrates income - it's positive, so it feels good to look at. The card has a subtle green accent border on the left (about 4px thick) that subtly reinforces "this is money coming in."

The label "Receita Total" sits at the top in a softer gray, clearly secondary. Below it, the amount displays prominently in large, bold, monospace font - "R$ 15.230,50" - easy to scan and compare. The formatting uses Brazilian standards: dot for thousands, comma for decimals.

To the right of the label, a small trend indicator shows whether income is up or down. An upward green arrow with "+12.5%" feels encouraging. A downward red arrow would signal attention needed. This gives context beyond just the number.

When users hover over this card (desktop), it subtly lifts with a deeper shadow, and the border shifts to sky blue - signaling it's clickable and will take them to income details.

SUMMARY CARD 2: TOTAL EXPENSES
--------------------------------
This card shows expenses with a red accent border. The visual treatment is identical to income but the red accent communicates "money going out" immediately. The amount is still prominent and readable, but the red context helps users understand this is different from income.

The trend indicator here is crucial - if expenses are trending down (good!) it shows green. If trending up, it shows red. This contextual color helps users understand if the trend is positive or negative for their financial health.

SUMMARY CARD 3: NET WORTH
--------------------------
This is the user's financial foundation number - their total wealth. It gets a sky blue accent border, the brand color, signaling this is a key metric. The number is displayed with the same prominence as income/expenses, but the sky blue accent makes it feel special and important.

SUMMARY CARD 4: MONTHLY BALANCE
--------------------------------
This card dynamically reflects financial health through color. When positive (more income than expenses), it has a green accent border and feels positive. When negative, it has a red accent border and may have a subtle red tint in the background - not alarming, but clearly signaling attention needed.

The amount shows as positive or negative with appropriate color coding, making the financial situation immediately clear.

SUMMARY CARD 5: SAVINGS RATE
-----------------------------
This percentage represents financial discipline and progress. It has a sky blue accent border. Below the percentage number, a thin progress bar (about 6px tall) visually represents the savings rate. When the bar is full or high, it feels accomplished. The bar uses sky blue to match the brand, creating a cohesive visual language.

CHARTS SECTION - VISUAL STORYTELLING
-------------------------------------
Two interactive charts sit side-by-side, telling the financial story over time. These are NOT placeholder images - they're fully interactive data visualizations that respond to user interaction.

Left Chart: Monthly Trends
---------------------------
This line chart tells the income and expense story over the last 12 months. It's beautifully rendered with smooth lines, clear labels, and an elegant color scheme.

The chart has a clean white background within a card that matches other dashboard elements. The title "Tendências Mensais" sits above, clearly labeling what users are seeing.

The X-axis shows months in Brazilian format: "Jan/24", "Fev/24", "Mar/24" - familiar and clear. The Y-axis shows amounts in R$ with clear formatting. Grid lines are subtle gray lines that help the eye track values without competing with the data.

Two lines tell the story:
- Income line: Vibrant green (#22C55E), smooth and upward-trending feels positive
- Expense line: Red (#EF4444), helps users see the relationship

Each month has a data point (small circle) on the line. When users hover over a point, a helpful tooltip appears showing exact values for that month. The tooltip has a dark background with white text, feels polished and informative.

When users click on a month, the chart could filter transactions to that period - making exploration feel natural and powerful. A legend at the top-right lets users toggle lines on/off, giving control over what they're viewing.

The chart feels smooth and responsive - animations when data loads, smooth interactions on hover. It's a tool for understanding, not just decoration.

Right Chart: Top Spending Categories
-------------------------------------
This donut chart shows where money is going. It's visually engaging and immediately understandable. The donut shape feels modern, and the center can display the total or highlight the largest category.

The chart uses distinct colors for each category - not random, but a thoughtful palette that's accessible and clear. Each segment is large enough to be easily distinguished and clicked.

Around the chart, a legend shows each category with its color, amount, percentage, and transaction count. This gives users multiple ways to understand the data: visually through the chart, numerically through the legend.

When users hover over a segment, it subtly highlights (lighter shade or slight separation from center), and a tooltip appears with precise details. Clicking a segment could filter transactions to that category - making exploration intuitive.

The donut chart feels balanced and informative - not overwhelming, but comprehensive. Colors are chosen for distinction and meaning (e.g., food might be warm orange, transportation might be blue).

Both charts sit in elegant cards with soft shadows, feeling elevated and important. They're the same height for visual balance, creating a harmonious two-column layout on desktop.

When loading, skeleton loaders match the chart shapes - users see the structure before data arrives, setting expectations.

If there's no data, an empty state appears: a large, friendly icon (maybe a chart or data visualization icon) in soft gray, with a helpful message: "Não há dados suficientes para exibir o gráfico" and guidance on how to add data.

GOAL PROGRESS TABLE - VISUAL MOTIVATION
----------------------------------------
This section shows financial goals with visual progress that motivates continued effort. It's organized in a clean table that feels manageable, not overwhelming.

The section has a white card background with a clear title "Progresso das Metas" that users can immediately understand. The table has a subtle header row with soft gray background that clearly defines columns without feeling heavy.

Each goal appears as a row with clear information hierarchy:
- Goal name and type badge are prominent - users know what they're working toward
- Progress bar is visual and satisfying - seeing the bar fill feels rewarding
- Amount display shows realistic progress - "R$ 5.000 / R$ 10.000" feels achievable
- Days remaining creates urgency without panic - "Faltam 120 dias" feels manageable

Progress bars are color-coded to communicate status:
- Red (0-50%): Early stage, just getting started
- Yellow/Amber (50-75%): Good progress, keep going
- Green (75-99%): Almost there, finish strong
- Gold/Emerald (100%): Accomplished, celebration

The progress bars animate smoothly when goals are updated - the bar filling feels rewarding and confirms progress.

Days remaining shows in the deadline column. If a goal is behind schedule (less than 30 days remaining but not at 100%), it appears in red to signal attention needed. Completed goals show "Concluído em [date]" in a satisfying green.

Each row has a subtle "Adicionar Progresso" button that's easily accessible but not overwhelming. It uses a light sky blue background that feels inviting rather than demanding.

When there are no goals, an inspiring empty state appears: a rocket or goal icon, encouraging text about starting their financial journey, and a clear call-to-action button to create the first goal. This feels motivating, not empty.

QUICK STATS CARDS - ACTIVITY OVERVIEW
-------------------------------------
Four smaller cards show activity metrics at a glance. These feel like quick reference points rather than primary information.

Each card follows the same visual language as summary cards but is slightly smaller and more focused. They have sky blue accent borders that tie them to the brand while keeping them visually distinct from the main summary cards.

Card 1: Total Transactions
- Shows transaction count prominently
- Has a subtle transaction icon
- Clicking navigates to full transaction list
- Hover state makes it clear it's interactive

Card 2: Pending Reconciliations
- Shows count with attention if > 0
- May have a small red badge if action needed
- Clicking goes to reconciliation view

Card 3: Active Goals
- Shows count of ongoing goals
- Has a flag or target icon
- Clicking filters goals to active only

Card 4: Completed Goals
- Celebrates completed goals with count
- Uses emerald/gold color for the icon
- Clicking filters to completed goals
- Feels like an achievement showcase

All quick stats cards are clickable and provide instant navigation to relevant sections. They feel like shortcuts rather than primary information - helpful but not overwhelming.

LOADING EXPERIENCE
------------------
When the dashboard loads, skeleton loaders appear that match the final layout. Cards show as light gray rectangles with subtle shimmer animation. Charts show as chart-shaped placeholders. This sets clear expectations and makes loading feel fast and intentional.

The shimmer effect is subtle and elegant - not distracting, just enough to show the system is working. Colors are muted grays that don't compete with actual content.

EMPTY STATE EXPERIENCE
----------------------
If a user is new or has no data, the dashboard doesn't feel empty or broken. Instead, it feels welcoming and instructive.

A friendly illustration or large icon appears (maybe a piggy bank, chart, or wallet icon) in a soft, approachable style. The message is encouraging: "Comece sua jornada financeira" or "Adicione sua primeira transação para ver seu dashboard."

A primary call-to-action button invites action: "Adicionar Transação" or "Começar Agora." This feels like an opportunity, not a problem.

The empty state doesn't appear for every metric - if a user has transactions but no goals, show the transaction data normally and only show empty state for the goals section. This makes the dashboard feel useful even when starting out.

RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
-------------------
On desktop, everything spreads elegantly: cards in a row, charts side-by-side, full table visible. Users see the big picture and details simultaneously.

On tablet, cards reorganize into a comfortable grid (maybe 3 on top row, 2 on bottom). Charts stack vertically but maintain full width. The table remains readable.

On mobile, everything stacks vertically. Cards become full-width but maintain their visual importance. Charts remain interactive but optimized for touch. The table may become horizontally scrollable or convert to cards - whichever feels more natural for the content.

Throughout all sizes, spacing adjusts intelligently - never cramped, always comfortable.

DARK MODE EXPERIENCE
--------------------
In dark mode, the dashboard feels sophisticated and comfortable for extended viewing. Backgrounds are deep but not black - a dark slate that's easy on the eyes. Cards are slightly lighter, creating clear separation through elevation rather than harsh borders.

Colors remain consistent: sky blue still feels like sky blue, green income indicators still feel positive, red expenses still signal attention. Text contrasts are carefully maintained for readability.

The overall feeling is premium and modern - like a high-end financial application that works beautifully in any lighting condition.

================================================================================
SCREEN 2: TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT WITH FILTER SIDEBAR
================================================================================

USER EXPERIENCE VISION
----------------------
This is the transaction management center - where users spend significant time reviewing, organizing, and understanding their spending and income. It should feel powerful yet approachable - like a sophisticated financial tool that's easy to use.

The page empowers users to find exactly what they're looking for quickly. Whether they're searching for a specific transaction, reviewing monthly expenses, or reconciling accounts, everything should be discoverable and actionable.

VISUAL LAYOUT PHILOSOPHY
-------------------------
The page uses a two-panel layout on desktop: filters on the left, transactions on the right. This feels natural - like having tools on one side and work on the other. On mobile, filters become a drawer that slides in when needed, keeping focus on transactions.

The header is sticky, so filters and search are always accessible. The transaction list flows smoothly with clear visual hierarchy - date, description, amount are immediately scannable.

FILTER SIDEBAR - POWERFUL BUT APPROACHABLE
-------------------------------------------
The filter sidebar is critical functionality - users need it to manage their transaction data effectively. It shouldn't feel like an advanced feature hidden away; it should feel like a natural part of the interface.

Visual Design:
The sidebar feels like a friendly assistant helping users find what they need. It has a clean white background (or dark slate in dark mode) that clearly separates it from the main content. A subtle border on the right defines the boundary without feeling harsh.

The sidebar header has "Filtros" clearly labeled, and a close button on mobile that's easily accessible. The header feels substantial enough to establish importance but not so heavy that it dominates.

Filter Organization:
Filters are organized logically, flowing from general to specific:
1. Search (text) - most general, start here
2. Date range - narrow down by time
3. Type (income/expense) - fundamental categorization
4. Category - specific organization
5. Subcategory - most specific categorization
6. Source - how money moved
7. Amount range - financial filters
8. Installments - special cases

Each filter group has a clear label and enough space to feel uncluttered. The spacing between groups gives each filter room to breathe.

Search Filter:
The search input feels welcoming with a search icon on the left. The placeholder text "Descrição da transação..." is helpful and instructive. When focused, the input glows with sky blue, signaling it's ready for input.

Date Range Filter:
Two date pickers sit side-by-side, clearly labeled "De" (From) and "Até" (To). They're sized comfortably for clicking/tapping. When a date is selected, it's clearly visible. The Brazilian date format (DD/MM/YYYY) feels natural.

Transaction Type Filter:
Radio buttons or a clean dropdown feel substantial - this is an important filter. The options "Todos", "Receita", "Despesa" are clearly labeled. When selected, the choice is visually obvious.

Category Filter:
A dropdown that loads categories from the system. When opened, it shows all available categories in a clean list. The dropdown feels searchable - users can type to filter options quickly. This makes large category lists manageable.

Subcategory Filter:
This appears dynamically when a category is selected. The transition feels smooth - the filter slides in or fades in, not jarring. It loads subcategories for that specific category, showing only relevant options. If loading takes a moment, a subtle loading indicator appears.

Source Multi-Select:
Checkboxes for each payment source feel organized and scannable. Each option has enough space to be easily clicked. Icons next to each option help visual recognition (credit card icon, bank icon, cash icon, etc.). Selected checkboxes clearly show the sky blue accent color.

Amount Range Filter:
Two number inputs for minimum and maximum amounts. The R$ prefix is clearly visible, reinforcing Brazilian currency. The inputs are sized for comfortable number entry. Placeholders "Mínimo" and "Máximo" are helpful.

Installments Toggle:
A toggle switch that feels modern and clear. When OFF, it's a soft gray. When ON, it's sky blue with the thumb clearly shifted right. The label "Apenas parceladas" explains what it does.

Active Filter Badge:
The filter toggle button in the header shows a small red badge with the number of active filters. This gives users confidence that filters are applied, and clicking the button will show them what's active. The badge is subtle but noticeable - not demanding attention unnecessarily.

Filter Actions:
Two buttons at the bottom of the sidebar:
- "Aplicar Filtros" - Primary sky blue button, feels like the main action
- "Limpar Filtros" - Secondary button, feels available but not pushy

These buttons are full-width in the sidebar, making them easy to tap on mobile.

Filter State Persistence:
On desktop, if a user opens the sidebar and applies filters, closing and reopening remembers the filter state. This feels thoughtful - the system remembers what the user was doing.

Sidebar Behavior:
- Desktop: Can be toggled open/closed. When closed, it slides off-screen smoothly. Users can choose based on screen space.
- Mobile: Slides in as a drawer overlay from the left. A backdrop dims the main content, clearly signaling the sidebar has focus. Backdrop is tappable to close.

TRANSACTION TABLE - SCANNABLE AND ACTIONABLE
---------------------------------------------
The transaction table is the heart of this screen. It needs to present a lot of information clearly while remaining scannable.

Table Structure:
The table feels organized and trustworthy. Headers are clearly defined with subtle background color that distinguishes them from data rows. Column headers are bold and use uppercase with letter spacing for clarity.

Each row has comfortable height - enough to scan quickly but compact enough to see many transactions. Rows alternate between white and very light gray backgrounds (subtle) for easier horizontal scanning, or use hover states to highlight the row being viewed.

Visual Hierarchy in Rows:
- Date is left-aligned, monospace font - easy to scan chronologically
- Description is prominent - this is what users remember
- Category appears with visual distinction (maybe a small colored dot or badge)
- Amount is right-aligned, bold, color-coded - the financial impact
- Source shows as an icon - quick visual recognition
- Actions are icon buttons - clear but not overwhelming

Amount Display:
Income amounts appear in green, making positive money flow immediately obvious. Expense amounts appear in red, clearly signaling money going out. The monospace font ensures decimal alignment, making comparison effortless.

The amount is formatted beautifully: "R$ 1.234,56" with proper Brazilian formatting. Large numbers use thousand separators (dots) for readability.

Category Display:
Categories appear with their name. If a subcategory exists, it shows as "Categoria > Subcategoria" with a subtle separator. This hierarchy is clear but not heavy.

Type Badges:
Small badges next to or within the category column show "RECEITA" or "DESPESA" with appropriate colors. These are small but clear - not competing with other information but providing quick categorization.

Action Buttons:
Three icon buttons per row: Edit, Delete, Reconcile. They're sized for easy clicking (at least 32px touch target) but don't dominate the row. They appear on hover (desktop) or are always visible (mobile). Colors are semantic: sky blue for edit, red for delete, green for reconcile.

Pagination:
Below the table, pagination controls feel accessible and clear. Page numbers are clickable, Previous/Next buttons are obvious. The current page is highlighted in sky blue. A page size selector lets users choose how many transactions to see per page.

The pagination feels responsive - users can navigate large datasets without feeling lost.

EMPTY STATES - GUIDED EXPERIENCE
--------------------------------
No Transactions Empty State:
When users have no transactions, the table area shows a friendly empty state. A large, soft icon (maybe a receipt or transaction icon) in a calming gray appears prominently. The message is encouraging: "Nenhuma transação encontrada. Comece adicionando sua primeira transação para começar a organizar suas finanças."

A primary sky blue button "Adicionar Transação" is prominently displayed. This feels like an opportunity to start, not a problem to solve.

No Search Results Empty State:
When filters return no results, the empty state changes context. The icon might be a search or filter icon. The message is helpful: "Nenhum resultado encontrado para os filtros selecionados. Tente ajustar seus filtros ou limpar para ver todas as transações."

The "Limpar Filtros" button is prominent, giving users an easy path forward.

Both empty states feel helpful and actionable - not dead ends, but guidance.

LOADING STATES - SMOOTH EXPECTATIONS
------------------------------------
When transactions are loading, skeleton rows appear that match the table structure. Five to ten skeleton rows give users a sense of structure while data loads. The skeletons have subtle shimmer animation that's pleasant and indicates progress.

Each skeleton row has placeholders that match column widths - users see the structure they'll get. This makes loading feel fast and intentional.

SEARCH AND TOOLBAR
------------------
Above the table, a toolbar provides quick actions and context. The results count "Mostrando X de Y transações" gives users context about what they're viewing. This feels informative, not cluttered.

Export options are accessible but not overwhelming. A dropdown button labeled "Exportar" opens a menu with options (CSV, JSON, Excel). When clicked, it shows a loading state, then confirms success with a toast notification.

View toggles let users switch between list and grid views if both are supported. The active view is clearly indicated with sky blue background.

RESPONSIVE TRANSFORMATION
--------------------------
On mobile, the experience transforms gracefully:
- Filter sidebar becomes a full-screen drawer that slides in from the left
- Table may convert to cards - each transaction becomes a card with all information stacked vertically
- Cards are easier to scan on mobile and provide more space for information
- Touch targets are larger (minimum 44px) for comfortable tapping
- Pagination adapts - maybe showing just Previous/Next with page count, not all page numbers

The mobile experience feels native and thoughtful, not a shrunken desktop version.

================================================================================
SCREEN 3: ADD/EDIT TRANSACTION FORM MODAL
================================================================================

USER EXPERIENCE VISION
----------------------
This modal is where users create and edit transactions - a critical interaction that happens frequently. It should feel straightforward and guided, like filling out a form with a helpful assistant.

The form should feel comprehensive but not overwhelming. Users should understand what's required, see their progress, and get helpful feedback throughout. When they're done, success should feel rewarding.

MODAL APPEARANCE - FOCUSED CONVERSATION
---------------------------------------
The modal appears gracefully, dimming the background to focus attention on the task. The modal itself scales in smoothly from slightly smaller (95%) to full size, with a subtle fade. This animation feels polished and signals importance.

The backdrop is semi-transparent black that clearly separates the modal from background content. Clicking the backdrop closes the modal (with confirmation if there are unsaved changes).

The modal size is generous enough to feel comfortable but not so large it dominates the screen. On desktop, it's about 896px wide (comfortable reading width). On mobile, it's full-screen for easier interaction.

MODAL HEADER - CLEAR PURPOSE
----------------------------
The header establishes context immediately. "Nova Transação" or "Editar Transação" is prominent and clear. The close button (X) is easily accessible in the top-right but not demanding attention - users can find it when needed.

A subtle border at the bottom of the header separates it from content, creating clear visual hierarchy.

FORM ORGANIZATION - LOGICAL FLOW
--------------------------------
The form is organized into logical sections that flow naturally:
1. What type of transaction (Income/Expense, Subtype, Source)
2. Basic details (Description, Amount, Date)
3. Organization (Category, Subcategory, Account)
4. Additional details (Installments, Notes)
5. Responsibilities (CRITICAL - how the amount is distributed)

Each section feels complete but connected. Spacing between sections gives breathing room and helps users process one section at a time.

TRANSACTION TYPE SELECTION
--------------------------
The transaction type selection feels important and clear. Radio buttons or a segmented control lets users choose Receita (Income) or Despesa (Expense) prominently. The selection feels substantial - this is a fundamental choice.

Visual distinction helps: Income might have a subtle green tint when selected, Expense might have a subtle red tint. This color coding reinforces the choice and helps users understand the impact.

The subtype selection appears below, feeling like a natural next step. "Fixa" (Fixed) or "Variável" (Variable) helps users categorize recurring vs. one-time transactions.

Source selection feels comprehensive - all the ways money can move are available. The dropdown is searchable if there are many options, making it manageable.

DESCRIPTION INPUT
-----------------
The description field feels welcoming. The placeholder "Ex: Almoço no restaurante" gives users a concrete example they can follow. The input is sized comfortably for typical transaction descriptions.

As users type, the field feels responsive. If there's a character limit, a subtle counter appears (maybe "145 / 255 caracteres") that doesn't feel restrictive.

AMOUNT INPUT - CURRENCY EXPERIENCE
----------------------------------
The amount input feels special - this is the core financial data. It has an R$ prefix that's always visible, reinforcing Brazilian currency. The input formats numbers as users type, automatically adding thousand separators and decimal formatting.

When a user types "1500.50", it transforms to "R$ 1.500,50" - this feels helpful and precise. The formatting happens smoothly, not jarringly. Numbers use monospace font so they align beautifully.

The input field is sized generously - users can see the full amount clearly even for large numbers. The right alignment (for numbers) helps with scanning and comparison.

DATE AND TIME SELECTION
-----------------------
Date selection feels natural with a date picker that opens on focus. The picker uses Brazilian date format and feels familiar. Time selection is separate but connected - two inputs side-by-side that feel like one cohesive selection.

When a date is selected, it displays clearly. The format "15/07/2024 14:30" feels natural and readable.

CATEGORY SELECTION
------------------
Category dropdown feels comprehensive and searchable. Users can type to filter categories, making large lists manageable. When a category is selected, subcategories load dynamically below it.

The subcategory dropdown appears smoothly when a category is chosen - not jarring, just a natural next step. If there are no subcategories, the field might be hidden or clearly marked as not available.

Loading states during category/subcategory loading are subtle - maybe a small spinner or "Carregando..." text that doesn't feel slow or broken.

SOURCE ENTITY SELECTION
-----------------------
The account/entity selection shows user's financial accounts in a helpful format: "Conta Corrente - Itaú (****5678)" or "Cartão Nubank (****9012)". The masked numbers provide security while still being recognizable.

This dropdown feels like selecting from familiar options - users recognize their own accounts.

INSTALLMENTS SECTION
---------------------
The installments section appears clearly but doesn't dominate. Two number inputs side-by-side create "X de Y" format that feels intuitive. The inputs are sized for comfortable number entry (maybe 2-3 digits each).

This section only appears or becomes prominent when relevant - if a user typically doesn't use installments, it doesn't feel in the way.

NOTES FIELD
-----------
The notes field is a textarea that feels optional and helpful. It's sized for short notes (maybe 3-4 lines visible) but can expand if needed. The placeholder "Adicione observações sobre a transação..." invites users to add context without feeling required.

RESPONSIBILITIES SECTION - CRITICAL FEATURE
-------------------------------------------
This section is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL and MUST be included. It appears after all other transaction details, feeling like the final step in creating a complete transaction.

Visual Design:
The section has a light background (maybe soft gray or sky blue tint) that visually groups it as a distinct but important section. A border around the entire section creates clear boundaries. The section header is prominent: "Responsabilidades" with a red asterisk (*) indicating it's required.

Helpful Context:
Below the title, explanatory text appears: "Distribua o valor da transação entre as pessoas responsáveis. O total deve ser 100%." This text feels helpful, not instructional - it explains why this matters.

Add Button:
A prominent "Adicionar" button (sky blue) invites users to add responsibilities. The button feels accessible and clear. When clicked, a new responsibility item appears smoothly.

Responsibility Items:
Each responsibility appears as a card-like container with a clean layout. The container has subtle borders and padding that makes it feel organized.

Each responsibility has four key fields arranged in a grid:
1. Responsible dropdown (left, takes more space)
2. Percentage input (compact, numeric)
3. Calculated amount display (readonly, shows result)
4. Notes (optional, for context)
5. Delete button (right side, easily accessible)

The layout feels balanced - the responsible dropdown is largest (it's the most important), percentage is compact (it's a number), calculated amount is prominent (it's the result), notes are flexible (they're optional).

Responsible Dropdown:
This loads from the system (GET /transaction-responsibles) and shows all available people. Options might be "João Silva", "Maria Santos", "Casal", "Família" - whatever makes sense for the user's context.

The dropdown feels substantial - selecting who's responsible is important. It's required (marked with asterisk) and visually clear when empty.

Percentage Input:
This is a number input that accepts decimals (0.01 steps). Users can enter values like 60, 60.5, or 33.33. The input has a "%" suffix that's always visible.

As users type, the system calculates the amount in real-time and displays it immediately in the calculated amount field. This feels responsive and helpful - users see the math happening.

The input clamps to 0-100 range. If users try to enter values outside this range, the system adjusts automatically or shows validation feedback.

Calculated Amount Display:
This field is readonly and styled differently (maybe lighter background) to signal it's automatically calculated. It shows the amount in Brazilian currency format: "R$ 900,00".

The calculation happens instantly: if transaction amount is R$ 1.500,00 and percentage is 60%, this shows "R$ 900,00" immediately. This transparency builds trust.

Notes Field (Optional):
A small text input for optional notes about this specific responsibility. Maybe "João pagou mais porque comprou itens pessoais" - adds context without complexity.

Delete Button:
Each responsibility has a delete button (red trash icon) on the right. When there's only one responsibility, this button is disabled (grayed out) with a tooltip explaining why. This prevents users from accidentally removing all responsibilities.

Multiple Responsibilities:
Users can add multiple responsibilities. Each appears as a new card below the previous one. The spacing between items is comfortable - they feel organized but not cramped.

Total Percentage Indicator:
Below all responsibility items, a prominent summary appears. It shows "Total: XX.XX%" in large, bold text. This is the key validation point.

Visual Feedback:
- When total = 100%: The percentage appears in vibrant green (#22C55E) with a checkmark icon. Text might say "Percentual válido" in green. This feels accomplished and ready.
- When total ≠ 100%: The percentage appears in red (#EF4444) with an error message "O total deve ser exatamente 100%" in red below it. This is clear but not scolding - it's helping users complete the task.

The color change is immediate as users adjust percentages, providing real-time feedback. The transition feels smooth, not jarring.

Validation Behavior:
The form cannot be submitted if the total doesn't equal 100%. The submit button is disabled (grayed out, not clickable) with appropriate cursor styling. This prevents frustration from submitting invalid data.

The validation message appears clearly but doesn't dominate - it's helpful guidance, not a barrier.

User Experience Flow:
1. User enters transaction amount: R$ 1.500,00
2. User clicks "Adicionar" in responsibilities section
3. First responsibility item appears
4. User selects "João Silva" from dropdown
5. User enters "60" in percentage field
6. Calculated amount immediately shows "R$ 900,00"
7. User clicks "Adicionar" again
8. Second item appears
9. User selects "Maria Santos"
10. User enters "40" in percentage
11. Calculated amount shows "R$ 600,00"
12. Total indicator shows "Total: 100% ✓" in green
13. Success message appears: "Percentual válido"
14. Submit button becomes enabled
15. User can submit the form

This flow feels natural and guided - users understand what's happening at each step.

FORM VALIDATION - HELPFUL GUIDANCE
----------------------------------
Throughout the form, validation feels helpful, not punitive:
- Required fields are clearly marked with asterisks
- Empty required fields show red borders and helpful error messages when user tries to submit or leaves the field
- Error messages are specific: "Este campo é obrigatório" or "Por favor, insira uma data válida" - they tell users exactly what's wrong and how to fix it
- Success states are subtle - when a field is valid, a small green checkmark appears next to it, confirming correctness without drawing too much attention
- Date validation ensures dates are in the past or present (no future dates for transactions)
- Amount validation prevents negative values or zero amounts
- Category/subcategory dependency is validated - if subcategory is selected, category must be selected first

The validation happens in real-time as users interact with fields, but error messages don't appear immediately on every keystroke - they appear when a user leaves a field (blur) or tries to submit. This prevents frustration from seeing errors while still typing.

SUBMIT BUTTON STATES - CLEAR FEEDBACK
-------------------------------------
The submit button tells users exactly what's happening at all times:

Default State:
The button is sky blue with white text, prominent and inviting. It says "Salvar Transação" or "Atualizar Transação" depending on whether it's create or edit mode. The button feels substantial - users know this is the main action.

Disabled State:
When the form is invalid (missing required fields, responsibilities don't sum to 100%, etc.), the button becomes gray with reduced opacity. It's clearly disabled but still visible - users can see it and understand why they can't submit yet. The cursor changes to "not-allowed" when hovering over it.

Loading State:
When the form is being submitted, the button transforms smoothly. A spinner appears next to the text, and the button text changes to "Salvando..." in a lighter shade. The entire button becomes disabled and slightly dimmed. This gives users confidence that their action is being processed - the system is working.

Success State:
After successful submission, the modal begins to close smoothly. A toast notification appears (if not already shown) confirming success: "Transação criada com sucesso!" or "Transação atualizada com sucesso!" This feels rewarding - users know their work was saved and completed.

Error State:
If submission fails, the button returns to its enabled state, and an error message appears prominently at the top of the form. The message is helpful: "Erro ao salvar transação. Por favor, verifique os dados e tente novamente." Specific validation errors from the API are displayed inline next to the relevant fields. This doesn't feel like a failure - it feels like the system is helping users fix the problem.

FORM SUBMISSION FLOW - COMPLETE EXPERIENCE
------------------------------------------
When users click submit, the experience is smooth and confident:

1. Form validation runs one final time - all fields are checked
2. If valid, loading state activates immediately - users see instant feedback
3. API call happens in the background - users don't need to wait anxiously
4. On success: Toast notification appears, modal closes smoothly, transaction list refreshes to show the new transaction
5. On error: Form remains open, error messages appear, users can fix and retry

The entire flow feels intentional and smooth - users understand what's happening at each step. No confusion, no anxiety, just clear progress toward completion.

MODAL CLOSING EXPERIENCE
-------------------------
When the modal closes (after successful submission or when users click cancel/close), it does so gracefully:

- The backdrop fades out smoothly
- The modal itself scales down slightly and fades out
- Focus returns to the trigger button or appropriate page element
- The page behind is no longer dimmed, signaling users can interact again

If users have unsaved changes and try to close, a friendly confirmation dialog appears: "Você tem alterações não salvas. Deseja realmente fechar?" This prevents accidental data loss while not being aggressive about it.

The modal experience overall feels polished and professional - like a well-designed conversation between the system and the user.

================================================================================
SCREEN 4: FINANCIAL GOALS TRACKING AND MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

USER EXPERIENCE VISION
----------------------
This screen is where users see their financial aspirations come to life. It's a motivational space that celebrates progress while showing the path forward. When users arrive here, they should feel inspired and empowered - their goals feel achievable, their progress is visible, and the system is helping them succeed.

The screen balances information with motivation. It's not just a list of goals - it's a visual story of financial growth, discipline, and achievement. Users see where they started, where they are now, and how close they are to each goal.

VISUAL HIERARCHY - WHAT USERS NOTICE FIRST
-------------------------------------------
1. Statistics summary cards at the top - overall progress at a glance
2. Active goals grid - their current financial journeys
3. Filter controls - organizing goals by status or type
4. Add Goal button - the clear path to creating new aspirations

The eye flows naturally: stats → goals → filters → actions

PAGE LAYOUT STRUCTURE
---------------------
The page opens with an elegant header that greets users warmly. Below that, three summary cards show key metrics: Total Goals, Active Goals, and Completed Goals. These cards use sky blue accents to tie into the brand while celebrating different aspects of goal achievement.

The main content area displays goal cards in a responsive grid. On desktop, goals appear side-by-side in a comfortable 3-column layout. On tablet, it becomes 2 columns. On mobile, goals stack vertically but remain visually important and easy to interact with.

STATISTICS SECTION - OVERALL PROGRESS
-------------------------------------
Three summary cards sit prominently at the top of the page, giving users an immediate sense of their goal portfolio:

Card 1: Total Goals
This card shows the complete count of all goals ever created. It has a sky blue accent border and displays a large, bold number. Below the number, a subtle description explains "Total de metas criadas" - this helps users understand the metric. The card feels comprehensive but not overwhelming.

Card 2: Active Goals
This card highlights goals currently in progress. It uses a vibrant green accent border to signal "active" and "growing." The number is prominent, and the description "Metas em andamento" clearly communicates what this means. When users have active goals, this number feels positive and motivating.

Card 3: Completed Goals
This card celebrates achievements. It uses an emerald or gold accent border to signal accomplishment. The number represents success - each completed goal is a financial milestone achieved. The description "Metas concluídas" reinforces the sense of accomplishment.

All three cards are clickable - clicking filters the goals list below to show only that category. This creates an intuitive navigation flow where users can drill down into specific goal types.

GOAL CARDS - VISUAL MOTIVATION
------------------------------
Each goal appears as an elegant card that tells a complete story. The card feels substantial - not cramped, not oversized - just right for displaying all necessary information clearly.

Card Structure:
The card has a clean white background (or dark slate in dark mode) with a subtle border. The top portion features the goal name prominently - this is what users are working toward, so it deserves prominence. The name is in a comfortable, readable font size that feels important but not overwhelming.

Goal Type Badge:
Below or beside the name, a small badge appears showing the goal type: "Fundos de Emergência" (Emergency Fund), "Férias" (Vacation), "Reserva" (Savings), etc. Each type has a distinct color that helps visual categorization. The badge is compact but clear - users can quickly understand what type of goal this is.

Progress Visualization:
The most important visual element is the progress bar. It spans the width of the card and shows completion percentage through both color fill and numerical display. The bar uses a gradient that transitions based on progress:
- 0-25%: Soft red/amber - early stage, just beginning
- 25-50%: Amber/yellow - making progress, keep going
- 50-75%: Yellow/green - more than halfway, momentum building
- 75-99%: Green - almost there, finish strong
- 100%: Emerald/gold - accomplished, celebration

Above or within the progress bar, the percentage appears in large, bold numbers. "45%" or "87%" - these numbers feel significant and motivating. When users see their progress, it feels like an achievement.

Amount Display:
The card clearly shows financial progress through amount display. The format "R$ 4.500 / R$ 10.000" feels concrete and achievable. The current amount appears in a slightly larger font, while the target feels like the destination. The Brazilian currency formatting (R$ with proper thousand separators) makes this feel native and trustworthy.

When the goal is completed, both amounts appear in the same size, and a checkmark icon appears next to the amounts - this visual confirmation feels rewarding.

Deadline Information:
Below the amounts, deadline information appears. For active goals, it shows "Faltam X dias" (X days remaining). This creates appropriate urgency without panic. When a deadline is approaching (less than 30 days), the text appears in amber or red to signal attention needed.

For completed goals, it shows "Concluído em [date]" in a satisfying green. This celebrates achievement and creates a timeline of success.

Status Badge:
Each card displays a status badge in the top-right corner:
- "Em Andamento" (In Progress) - sky blue background
- "Em Risco" (At Risk) - amber background, for goals behind schedule
- "Concluído" (Completed) - emerald background with checkmark
- "Pausado" (Paused) - gray background, for temporarily paused goals

These badges give immediate context about each goal's state.

GOAL CARD ACTIONS - QUICK INTERACTIONS
---------------------------------------
Each goal card has quick action buttons that feel accessible but not overwhelming:

Add Progress Button:
A sky blue button labeled "Adicionar Progresso" appears prominently on each active goal card. When clicked, a small modal or inline form appears allowing users to quickly add an amount to the current progress. This feels efficient - users don't need to navigate away or open a full edit form for this common action.

The button uses sky blue to match the brand and feel inviting. It's sized appropriately for easy clicking/tapping on all devices.

More Actions Menu:
A subtle three-dot menu icon appears in the top-right corner of each card. When clicked or hovered, a dropdown menu appears with options:
- "Editar" (Edit) - opens full edit form
- "Adicionar Progresso" (Add Progress) - quick progress update
- "Concluir" (Complete) - marks goal as completed
- "Pausar" (Pause) - temporarily pauses the goal
- "Excluir" (Delete) - removes the goal (with confirmation)

The menu feels organized and clear - each action is clearly labeled. Destructive actions (Delete) appear in red text to signal their significance.

When users hover over a goal card (desktop), the card subtly lifts with a deeper shadow, signaling it's interactive. This provides tactile feedback even before clicking.

FILTERING AND VIEW OPTIONS
---------------------------
Above the goal cards, filtering controls help users organize their goals:

Status Filter:
Segmented button controls let users filter by status: "Todas" (All), "Em Andamento" (Active), "Concluídas" (Completed). The active filter is highlighted in sky blue with white text. Other options use a subtle gray background. This makes the current filter obvious while keeping other options accessible.

Type Filter:
A dropdown allows users to filter by goal type: "Todas" (All), "Fundos de Emergência" (Emergency Fund), "Férias" (Vacation), etc. The dropdown feels comprehensive but manageable - even with many types, it's easy to scan and select.

View Toggle:
Icon buttons let users switch between grid view (default) and list view. The active view is highlighted. Grid view shows cards side-by-side, while list view shows goals in a more compact vertical list - useful when users have many goals.

Sort Options:
A subtle sort dropdown lets users organize goals by: "Mais Recentes" (Most Recent), "Prazo" (Deadline), "Progresso" (Progress), "Valor" (Amount). This helps users prioritize and focus on goals that need attention.

EMPTY STATE - INSPIRING START
-----------------------------
When users have no goals, the screen doesn't feel empty or broken. Instead, it feels like an opportunity:

A large, friendly illustration appears - perhaps a goal flag, a target, or a piggy bank. The illustration uses soft colors that feel approachable and positive, not intimidating.

The heading is encouraging: "Comece sua jornada financeira" (Start your financial journey). This feels inviting, not demanding.

Descriptive text explains the value: "Crie suas primeiras metas financeiras e acompanhe seu progresso. Cada meta te aproxima dos seus sonhos." (Create your first financial goals and track your progress. Each goal brings you closer to your dreams.)

A prominent sky blue button invites action: "Criar Primeira Meta" (Create First Goal). This button feels like an opportunity, not an obligation. When clicked, it opens the goal creation form.

The empty state overall feels motivating and supportive - the system is ready to help users start their financial journey, not pointing out what's missing.

LOADING STATES - SMOOTH EXPECTATIONS
------------------------------------
When goals are loading, skeleton cards appear that match the final card layout. These skeletons have subtle shimmer animation that indicates progress without being distracting. The skeleton structure shows where each element will appear - goal name placeholder, progress bar placeholder, amount placeholders. This sets clear expectations and makes loading feel fast and intentional.

When individual actions are loading (like adding progress), a small spinner appears on the relevant button or card, and the action is disabled until complete. This prevents accidental double-clicks and provides clear feedback.

RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
--------------------
The goal cards adapt beautifully across devices:

Desktop (>1024px):
Goals appear in a comfortable 3-column grid. Each card has generous spacing, and users can see multiple goals at once. The layout feels spacious and organized.

Tablet (768px-1024px):
Goals reorganize into a 2-column grid. Cards remain visually important and maintain all their information clearly. The layout feels balanced and comfortable for medium screens.

Mobile (<768px):
Goals stack vertically in a single column. Each card expands to full width, making information easy to read and interact with. Touch targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44px) for comfortable tapping. The cards maintain all their visual importance and information - nothing feels cramped or hidden.

Throughout all screen sizes, spacing adjusts intelligently to maintain visual breathing room.

DARK MODE EXPERIENCE
--------------------
In dark mode, goal cards maintain their visual importance through elevation and contrast rather than harsh borders. The progress bars remain vibrant and clear, providing visual motivation even in low-light viewing. The sky blue accents adapt to lighter variants for better contrast against dark backgrounds, while maintaining the brand identity.

The overall feeling is sophisticated and comfortable for extended viewing - users can track their goals in any lighting condition.

================================================================================
SCREEN 5: ADD/EDIT GOAL FORM MODAL
================================================================================

USER EXPERIENCE VISION
----------------------
This modal is where financial dreams become concrete goals. It should feel empowering and achievable - users are setting themselves up for financial success, and the form guides them through that process clearly and supportively.

The modal appears when users want to create a new goal or edit an existing one. It focuses attention on the task at hand while keeping the form comprehensive enough to create meaningful goals.

MODAL APPEARANCE - FOCUSED CREATION
-----------------------------------
The modal appears gracefully, dimming the background to focus on goal creation. The backdrop is semi-transparent black that clearly separates the modal from background content. The modal itself scales in smoothly from slightly smaller (95%) to full size, with a subtle fade.

The modal size is generous enough to feel comfortable but focused - about 896px wide on desktop, full-screen on mobile for easier interaction. This feels like a conversation about financial planning, not a cramped form-filling exercise.

MODAL HEADER - CLEAR PURPOSE
----------------------------
The header establishes context immediately. "Nova Meta Financeira" (New Financial Goal) or "Editar Meta Financeira" (Edit Financial Goal) is prominent and clear. The close button (X) is easily accessible in the top-right but not demanding attention - users can find it when needed.

A subtle border at the bottom of the header separates it from content, creating clear visual hierarchy.

FORM ORGANIZATION - LOGICAL FLOW
--------------------------------
The form is organized into logical sections that flow naturally:

1. Goal identification (Name, Type, Description)
2. Financial targets (Current Amount, Target Amount)
3. Timeline (Deadline)
4. Configuration (Auto-calculate, Account linking)
5. Actions (Save, Cancel)

Each section feels complete but connected. Spacing between sections gives breathing room and helps users process one section at a time.

GOAL NAME INPUT
---------------
The goal name field feels welcoming and important. The label "Nome da Meta" sits clearly above the input. The placeholder text gives a helpful example: "Ex: Férias na Europa" (Ex: Vacation in Europe). This helps users think concretely about their goals.

The input field is sized comfortably for typical goal names. As users type, the field feels responsive. Character limits (if any) are handled gracefully - perhaps a subtle counter appears when approaching the limit.

GOAL TYPE SELECTION
-------------------
The goal type dropdown feels comprehensive and helpful. Users select from predefined types that align with common financial goals:
- "Fundos de Emergência" (Emergency Fund)
- "Poupança" (Savings)
- "Férias" (Vacation)
- "Compra" (Purchase)
- "Investimento" (Investment)
- "Pagamento de Dívidas" (Debt Payoff)
- "Outro" (Other)

Each type option has a small icon next to it for visual recognition. The dropdown feels searchable if there are many options, making selection quick and easy.

When a type is selected, it's clearly visible. The selection feels substantial - this categorization helps users organize their financial goals.

DESCRIPTION FIELD
-----------------
The description field is optional but helpful. It's a textarea sized for a few sentences - enough to provide context without feeling like an essay requirement. The placeholder "Descreva sua meta financeira..." (Describe your financial goal...) invites users to add meaningful context.

This field helps users create goals that feel personal and meaningful, not just abstract financial targets.

AMOUNT FIELDS - FINANCIAL TARGETS
---------------------------------
The amount fields are the core of the goal - where users are now and where they want to be.

Current Amount:
This field shows where users are starting. It has an R$ prefix that's always visible, reinforcing Brazilian currency. The input formats numbers as users type, automatically adding thousand separators and decimal formatting.

The label "Valor Atual" (Current Amount) is clear, and help text below explains: "Quanto você já tem guardado para esta meta" (How much you already have saved for this goal). This contextual help makes the field's purpose clear.

The field is optional for new goals - users might be starting from zero. When editing existing goals, the current amount shows the accumulated progress, making it clear how far they've come.

Target Amount:
This field represents the destination - the financial goal itself. It uses the same R$ formatting as the current amount. The label "Valor Meta" (Target Amount) is prominent, and help text explains: "Quanto você precisa atingir" (How much you need to reach).

The target amount is required - this is the core of the goal. Validation ensures it's greater than zero and greater than the current amount (if current amount is provided). If users enter a target less than current, a helpful error message appears: "O valor meta deve ser maior que o valor atual" (Target amount must be greater than current amount).

Progress Calculation:
As users enter both amounts, the form automatically calculates progress percentage and displays it prominently. "45% concluído" (45% completed) appears with a visual progress indicator. This real-time feedback helps users understand their goal's status immediately.

DEADLINE SELECTION
------------------
The deadline picker helps users set realistic timelines. It opens on focus and uses Brazilian date format. The label "Prazo" (Deadline) is clear, and help text explains: "Data limite para alcançar a meta" (Deadline to reach the goal).

When a date is selected, it displays clearly in format "15/07/2025" - familiar and readable. The picker allows dates in the future only - users can't set goals with past deadlines.

An optional "Sem prazo" (No deadline) toggle lets users create open-ended goals that don't have time pressure. When toggled, the date field becomes disabled, and the goal is marked as open-ended.

AUTO-CALCULATE TOGGLE
---------------------
This feature lets users link goal progress to account balances automatically. The toggle appears as a modern switch - OFF is gray, ON is sky blue with the thumb clearly shifted.

The label "Calcular automaticamente" (Calculate automatically) is clear, with help text: "Atualizar progresso baseado no saldo da conta vinculada" (Update progress based on linked account balance).

When enabled, an account selection dropdown appears below it. Users select which account balance should track toward this goal. This creates automatic progress updates as account balances change, making goal tracking effortless.

ACCOUNT LINKING
---------------
When auto-calculate is enabled, the account selection dropdown shows user's financial accounts in a helpful format: "Conta Corrente - Itaú" or "Poupança - Nubank". The masked account numbers or clear account names help users recognize their accounts.

This feature creates a seamless connection between account balances and goal progress - users see their goals advance automatically as they save money.

FORM VALIDATION - SUPPORTIVE GUIDANCE
-------------------------------------
Validation throughout the form feels helpful:

- Goal name is required - shows error if empty on submit
- Target amount is required and must be positive - shows helpful error messages
- Deadline validation ensures future dates only
- Current amount validation ensures it's less than target amount if both provided
- Description is optional - no validation needed

Error messages appear below relevant fields in red, with specific guidance: "Este campo é obrigatório" or "O valor deve ser maior que zero." Success indicators (green checkmarks) appear when fields are valid.

The form cannot be submitted if required fields are invalid. The submit button is disabled until all validation passes, preventing frustration from submitting incomplete data.

SUBMIT AND CANCEL ACTIONS
-------------------------
At the bottom of the modal, two buttons provide clear actions:

Cancel Button:
This appears on the left, using a subtle gray background. It feels available but not pushy. When clicked, the modal closes. If there are unsaved changes, a confirmation dialog appears asking if users want to discard changes.

Save Button:
This appears on the right, using sky blue with white text - the primary action. It says "Salvar Meta" (Save Goal) or "Atualizar Meta" (Update Goal) depending on mode. When clicked, validation runs, and if valid, the form submits.

During submission, the button shows a loading state with spinner and "Salvando..." (Saving...) text. On success, a toast notification appears: "Meta criada com sucesso!" (Goal created successfully!) or "Meta atualizada com sucesso!" (Goal updated successfully!), and the modal closes smoothly.

On error, error messages appear at the top of the form, and users can fix and retry. The button returns to normal state, ready for another attempt.

SUCCESS EXPERIENCE
------------------
After successful goal creation or update, the experience feels rewarding:

1. Toast notification confirms success
2. Modal closes smoothly
3. Goals list refreshes to show the new/updated goal
4. If it's a new goal, users might see it highlighted briefly or at the top of the list

This creates a sense of accomplishment - users have taken a concrete step toward their financial goals, and the system confirms their action.

The entire form experience feels supportive and empowering - users are setting themselves up for financial success, and the system is helping them do it clearly and effectively.

SCREEN 6: BRAZILIAN MARKET INVESTMENTS TRACKING
================================================================================

USER EXPERIENCE VISION
----------------------
This screen is where Brazilian investors track their portfolio performance with clarity and confidence. It's a professional space that respects the complexity of market investing while making information accessible and actionable. When users arrive here, they should feel informed and in control - their investments are visible, their performance is clear, and the market context helps them make informed decisions.

The screen balances real-time market data with portfolio management. It's not just numbers on a screen - it's a comprehensive view of how Brazilian investments are performing, how the portfolio is allocated, and how economic indicators affect financial planning.

VISUAL HIERARCHY - WHAT USERS NOTICE FIRST
-------------------------------------------
1. Market status indicator - whether the market is open or closed
2. Economic indicators (SELIC, CDI, IPCA) - the Brazilian market context
3. Portfolio summary cards - overall performance at a glance
4. Investment table - detailed position-by-position tracking
5. Portfolio allocation visualization - where money is invested

The eye flows naturally: market status → indicators → portfolio summary → investments → allocation

PAGE LAYOUT STRUCTURE
---------------------
The page opens with a clear header that establishes this is the investment tracking section. Below that, a prominent market status indicator shows whether the Brazilian stock market (B3) is open or closed, with a color-coded indicator - green for open, gray for closed. This immediately sets context.

The economic indicators section follows - three cards displaying key Brazilian economic metrics that affect investment decisions. These feel important but not overwhelming - they provide context without dominating the screen.

Portfolio summary cards show aggregate metrics: Total Invested, Current Value, Total Gain/Loss, and Gain/Loss Percentage. These cards use color coding (green for gains, red for losses) to make performance immediately clear.

The main investment table displays individual positions with detailed information. Finally, a portfolio allocation chart visualizes how investments are distributed across asset types.

MARKET STATUS INDICATOR - IMMEDIATE CONTEXT
-------------------------------------------
At the top of the screen, a prominent status indicator shows the current state of the Brazilian stock market:

Market Open State:
When the market is open (trading hours), the indicator displays "Mercado Aberto" (Market Open) in a vibrant green color. A small animated pulse or indicator shows the system is tracking live data. This creates a sense of connection to real-time market activity.

Market Closed State:
When the market is closed, the indicator displays "Mercado Fechado" (Market Closed) in a subdued gray color. The last update time is shown: "Última atualização: 17:30" (Last update: 17:30), helping users understand when prices were last refreshed.

The indicator feels informative but not intrusive - it provides context without demanding attention. It updates automatically based on market hours, so users always know the status of their data.

ECONOMIC INDICATORS SECTION - BRAZILIAN MARKET CONTEXT
------------------------------------------------------
Three elegant cards display key Brazilian economic indicators that affect investment decisions. These indicators are critical for Brazilian investors to understand market conditions and make informed choices.

SELIC Rate Card:
The SELIC (Brazil's benchmark interest rate) appears prominently. The card shows the current rate with a clear label "SELIC" and displays the percentage: "10,50% a.a." (per year). A small trend indicator shows whether the rate is trending up (red) or down (green) from the previous period. This helps users understand monetary policy direction.

The card uses a sky blue accent border, tying it to the brand while making it visually distinct. The percentage is displayed in large, readable numbers - this is critical information for Brazilian investors.

CDI Rate Card:
The CDI (Interbank Deposit Certificate) rate appears similarly. It shows "CDI: 10,25% a.a." with trend indicators. The CDI is closely related to SELIC and helps investors understand fixed income opportunities. The card uses the same visual treatment as SELIC for consistency.

IPCA Card:
The IPCA (Brazilian inflation index) appears with its current value: "IPCA: 4,50% a.a." This indicator helps users understand inflation's impact on their investments' real returns. The card shows whether inflation is within the Central Bank's target range, providing additional context.

All three cards show "Última atualização: [date]" to help users understand data freshness. These indicators update periodically throughout the day, and users can manually refresh using a refresh button that appears on hover.

The indicators section feels comprehensive yet digestible - Brazilian investors get the context they need without information overload.

PORTFOLIO SUMMARY CARDS - OVERALL PERFORMANCE
-----------------------------------------------
Four summary cards provide an immediate view of portfolio health:

Card 1: Total Invested
This card shows the total amount invested across all positions. It has a sky blue accent border and displays the amount prominently: "R$ 125.000,00". The label "Total Investido" (Total Invested) is clear. This card represents the foundation - how much capital is in the market.

Card 2: Current Value
This card shows the current market value of all investments. It uses the same sky blue accent border. The amount "R$ 138.750,00" is prominent and displayed in the same format as Total Invested for easy comparison. The label "Valor Atual" (Current Value) clearly communicates what this represents.

Card 3: Total Gain/Loss (Amount)
This card dynamically shows performance in absolute terms. If the portfolio is up, it displays "R$ +13.750,00" in vibrant green with an upward arrow. If down, it displays "R$ -2.500,00" in red with a downward arrow. The color coding makes performance immediately clear - green feels positive, red signals attention needed.

Card 4: Gain/Loss Percentage
This card shows performance in relative terms: "+11,00%" in green or "-2,50%" in red. This percentage helps users understand performance relative to their investment amount. It's particularly useful for comparing different time periods or portfolios.

All four cards are clickable and might filter the investment table or show detailed breakdowns. They feel substantial and informative - users can quickly assess portfolio health.

INVESTMENT TABLE - DETAILED POSITION TRACKING
---------------------------------------------
The main investment table displays all positions with comprehensive information. Each row represents a single investment position and tells a complete story.

Table Structure:
The table has clear column headers that define information categories:
- Ticker (stock symbol)
- Nome (Company/Fund name)
- Tipo (Investment Type: Stock, FII, etc.)
- Quantidade (Quantity held)
- Preço Médio (Average purchase price)
- Preço Atual (Current market price)
- Valor Investido (Invested amount)
- Valor Atual (Current market value)
- Ganho/Perda (Gain/Loss)
- % Ganho/Perda (Gain/Loss percentage)
- Ações (Actions)

Column Details:

Ticker Column:
Stock symbols appear in a monospace font for easy scanning. Brazilian tickers like "PETR4", "VALE3", "ITUB4" are familiar and recognizable. The column is left-aligned for quick scanning.

Nome Column:
Full company or fund names appear clearly. For example, "Petrobras PN", "Vale ON", "Fundo Imobiliário HGLG11". These names help users identify investments quickly.

Tipo Column:
Investment type badges appear: "Ação" (Stock), "FII" (Real Estate Investment Trust), "ETF", etc. Each type has a distinct color that helps visual categorization. These badges are compact but clear.

Quantidade Column:
Share quantities appear in monospace font, right-aligned for numeric scanning. The format "150" or "1.250" makes quantities easy to compare.

Preço Médio Column:
Average purchase prices appear in Brazilian currency format: "R$ 28,50". These prices are right-aligned and use monospace font for easy comparison. This represents the cost basis for the position.

Preço Atual Column:
Current market prices appear prominently. They update in real-time when the market is open (indicated by a subtle pulsing animation). Prices are right-aligned and formatted: "R$ 32,75". When prices update, a subtle color flash (green if up, red if down) draws attention to the change briefly, then fades.

Valor Investido Column:
This shows the total amount invested in this position (quantity × average price). It's right-aligned and formatted: "R$ 4.275,00". This helps users understand position size relative to portfolio.

Valor Atual Column:
This shows the current market value (quantity × current price). It's right-aligned and formatted: "R$ 4.912,50". This updates in real-time when prices change.

Ganho/Perda Column:
Gains and losses appear in color-coded format. Gains show in green: "+R$ 637,50". Losses show in red: "-R$ 250,00". This color coding makes performance immediately obvious. The column is right-aligned for numeric comparison.

% Ganho/Perda Column:
Percentage gains and losses appear similarly color-coded: "+14,90%" in green or "-5,25%" in red. This helps users compare performance across different positions regardless of position size.

Ações Column:
Action buttons appear in this column: Edit (for manual price adjustments), Delete (for removing positions), and Refresh (for manually updating current price). These buttons are icon-based and appear on hover (desktop) or are always visible (mobile).

Row Interactions:
When users hover over a row (desktop), the row highlights subtly, signaling it's interactive. Clicking a row might expand it to show additional details like transaction history, dividend history, or performance charts.

Color Coding:
Rows with significant gains might have a subtle green tint in the background. Rows with significant losses might have a subtle red tint. This helps users quickly identify best and worst performers.

EMPTY STATE - STARTING INVESTMENT JOURNEY
-----------------------------------------
When users have no investments tracked, the table area shows a friendly empty state:

A large, professional illustration appears - perhaps a stock chart, a building (representing FIIs), or a portfolio icon. The illustration uses soft, approachable colors.

The heading is encouraging: "Comece a acompanhar seus investimentos" (Start tracking your investments). This feels inviting, not demanding.

Descriptive text explains the value: "Adicione seus investimentos brasileiros e acompanhe o desempenho em tempo real. Acompanhe ações, FIIs e outros ativos do mercado brasileiro." (Add your Brazilian investments and track real-time performance. Track stocks, FIIs, and other Brazilian market assets.)

A prominent sky blue button invites action: "Adicionar Primeiro Investimento" (Add First Investment). This button opens a form to add a new investment position.

The empty state overall feels professional and supportive - the system is ready to help users start their investment tracking journey.

PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION VISUALIZATION
----------------------------------
Below the investment table, a portfolio allocation chart shows how investments are distributed across asset types. This visualization helps users understand diversification and asset allocation.

The chart can be a donut chart or horizontal bar chart - either works, but the donut chart feels modern and engaging. Each segment represents an asset type (Stocks, FIIs, ETFs, etc.) and is color-coded distinctly.

Around the chart, a legend shows each asset type with:
- Asset type name
- Amount invested
- Percentage of portfolio
- Visual color indicator

When users hover over a segment (or bar), it highlights, and a tooltip appears with detailed information. Clicking a segment might filter the investment table to show only that asset type.

The chart updates automatically as users add or modify investments, providing real-time visualization of portfolio allocation.

LOADING STATES - SMOOTH EXPECTATIONS
-------------------------------------
When investment data is loading, skeleton rows appear that match the table structure. These skeletons have subtle shimmer animation that indicates progress without being distracting.

When prices are updating (real-time refresh), a subtle animation appears - perhaps a slight brightness pulse or a gentle highlight that moves across the price columns. This indicates data is fresh and updating, without being distracting.

The refresh button shows a spinner animation when manually refreshing data, and the button is disabled during the refresh to prevent multiple simultaneous requests.

RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
--------------------
The investment table adapts beautifully across devices:

Desktop (>1024px):
All columns are visible, and the table feels comprehensive. Users can see all information at once, making analysis efficient.

Tablet (768px-1024px):
The table becomes horizontally scrollable if needed, or less critical columns might be hidden. The core columns (Ticker, Name, Current Value, Gain/Loss) remain visible.

Mobile (<768px):
The table converts to cards - each investment becomes a card with all information stacked vertically. Cards are easier to scan on mobile and provide more space for information. Touch targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44px).

The portfolio summary cards reorganize into a 2x2 grid on tablet and stack vertically on mobile, maintaining visual importance.

DARK MODE EXPERIENCE
--------------------
In dark mode, the investment table maintains excellent readability. Color coding for gains and losses remains vibrant and clear - green still feels positive, red still signals attention. The sky blue accents adapt to lighter variants for better contrast.

The overall feeling is sophisticated and professional - like a premium investment tracking platform that works beautifully in any lighting condition.

REAL-TIME PRICE UPDATES
-----------------------
When the market is open, prices update automatically at configured intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes). These updates happen smoothly - prices don't jump abruptly but transition smoothly to new values. A subtle visual indicator (perhaps a brief color flash or highlight) draws attention to updated prices, then fades.

Users can also manually refresh prices using a refresh button that appears in the table header. When clicked, it shows a loading state and updates all prices. This gives users control over data freshness.

The real-time updates create a sense of connection to the live market - users feel like they're tracking their investments in real-time, not looking at stale data.

================================================================================
SCREEN 7: LOGIN SCREEN
================================================================================

USER EXPERIENCE VISION
----------------------
This is the gateway to financial control - the first impression that sets the tone for the entire application. It should feel welcoming, trustworthy, and secure. When users arrive here, they should feel confident that they're accessing a professional financial management system.

The login screen is clean and focused - no distractions, just a clear path to accessing financial data. It should feel modern yet approachable, secure yet not intimidating.

VISUAL HIERARCHY - WHAT USERS NOTICE FIRST
-------------------------------------------
1. Application branding/logo - establishes trust and recognition
2. Welcome message - personal and inviting
3. Email input field - the first step
4. Password input field - secure access
5. Login button - clear call to action
6. Secondary links - password recovery, registration

The eye flows naturally: branding → welcome → email → password → login → help links

PAGE LAYOUT STRUCTURE
---------------------
The page uses a centered layout that focuses attention on the login form. The background is subtle - perhaps a soft gradient using sky blue tones or a clean white/gray background. This creates a calm, professional atmosphere.

The login form sits in the center of the screen, elevated slightly with a subtle shadow or border. It feels like a card - substantial but not heavy. The form has generous padding and spacing, making it feel approachable and easy to use.

BRANDING AND LOGO
-----------------
At the top of the form, the application logo appears prominently. It might be a stylized icon representing finance or growth, along with the application name "Finance Control" or similar. The logo uses sky blue as the primary color, establishing brand identity immediately.

The branding feels professional and modern - users know they're in the right place and can trust this application with their financial data.

WELCOME MESSAGE
---------------
Below the logo, a warm welcome message appears: "Bem-vindo de volta!" (Welcome back!) or "Olá! Entre na sua conta" (Hello! Sign in to your account). This message feels personal and inviting - not robotic or formal.

The message uses a comfortable font size that's readable but not overwhelming. It sets a friendly tone for the authentication experience.

EMAIL INPUT FIELD
-----------------
The email field appears first, as it's the natural starting point for authentication. The label "E-mail" sits clearly above the input. The field has an email icon on the left side inside the input, providing visual context.

The placeholder text "seu@email.com" (your@email.com) gives users a clear example of the expected format. The input field is sized generously - wide enough to accommodate typical email addresses comfortably.

When focused, the input field glows with sky blue - like the system is paying attention and ready to help. The border changes from gray to sky blue, and a subtle shadow appears, signaling the field is active.

The input uses standard email validation - it checks format on blur (when users leave the field) and shows helpful error messages if invalid.

PASSWORD INPUT FIELD
--------------------
The password field appears below the email field with appropriate spacing. The label "Senha" (Password) is clear. The field has a lock icon on the left side, providing visual security context.

The input type is password (masked with dots) for security. Users see a password visibility toggle (eye icon) on the right side of the input. When clicked, it toggles between showing and hiding the password. This helps users verify they've entered their password correctly, especially on mobile devices.

When focused, the password field uses the same sky blue glow as the email field, maintaining visual consistency.

REMEMBER ME CHECKBOX
--------------------
Below the password field, a "Lembrar-me" (Remember me) checkbox appears. This checkbox uses modern styling - not a plain browser checkbox, but a styled toggle or custom checkbox that matches the design system.

When checked, it stores the user's login credentials (securely) so they don't need to re-enter them on future visits. This convenience feature feels helpful without compromising security messaging.

The checkbox is easily clickable with appropriate touch target size (minimum 44px).

LOGIN BUTTON
------------
The primary action button "Entrar" (Sign In) appears prominently below the form fields. It uses sky blue background with white text - the brand color establishes trust and signals this is the main action.

The button is full-width within the form, making it easy to click on all devices. It has generous padding (comfortable height) and rounded corners that feel modern.

When hovered (desktop), the button slightly darkens (sky blue 600) and lifts with a deeper shadow - providing tactile feedback. When clicked, it shows a loading state with a spinner and "Entrando..." (Signing in...) text. The button becomes disabled during the authentication process to prevent multiple submission attempts.

If authentication succeeds, the button briefly shows a success state (perhaps a checkmark) before redirecting to the dashboard. If authentication fails, the button returns to normal state, and error messages appear.

ERROR HANDLING
--------------
When login fails (invalid email, incorrect password, account locked, etc.), error messages appear prominently but helpfully:

- Error messages appear at the top of the form in a red-bordered box
- The message is specific: "E-mail ou senha incorretos" (Incorrect email or password) or "Esta conta está temporariamente bloqueada" (This account is temporarily locked)
- Field-level errors appear below relevant fields (if email format is invalid, error appears below email field)
- Error messages are in Portuguese and feel helpful, not scolding

The error state doesn't feel like a failure - it feels like the system is helping users fix the problem. After a few failed attempts, additional security messaging might appear about account protection.

FORGOT PASSWORD LINK
---------------------
Below the login button, a "Esqueceu sua senha?" (Forgot your password?) link appears. This link uses a subtle gray color that's readable but clearly secondary to the login button.

When clicked, it navigates to the password recovery screen. The link feels helpful and accessible - users who need it can find it easily, but it doesn't distract from the main login flow.

REGISTRATION LINK
-----------------
At the bottom of the form, a registration link appears: "Não tem uma conta? Cadastre-se" (Don't have an account? Sign up). This link uses the same styling as the forgot password link.

The link clearly communicates the action and destination. When clicked, it navigates to the registration screen.

SECURITY MESSAGING
------------------
Subtle security messaging might appear at the bottom of the form: "Seus dados estão protegidos" (Your data is protected) or a small SSL/lock icon indicating secure connection. This messaging feels reassuring without being overwhelming.

The messaging reinforces trust - users know their financial data is being handled securely.

LOADING STATE
-------------
During authentication, the login form shows clear loading feedback:

1. The login button shows a spinner and "Entrando..." text
2. All form fields become disabled
3. The submit button becomes disabled
4. A subtle loading overlay might appear on the form

This prevents accidental double-submission and clearly communicates that the system is processing the request.

SUCCESS FLOW
------------
After successful authentication:

1. The button shows a brief success state (checkmark)
2. A success message might appear: "Login realizado com sucesso!" (Login successful!)
3. The page transitions smoothly to the dashboard
4. A brief welcome animation or greeting appears on the dashboard

The transition feels smooth and rewarding - users successfully accessed their financial data.

RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
--------------------
The login form adapts beautifully across devices:

Desktop (>1024px):
The form appears centered with comfortable width (maybe 400px). The layout feels spacious and organized.

Tablet (768px-1024px):
The form maintains similar width but adjusts padding for comfortable viewing. Touch targets remain appropriately sized.

Mobile (<768px):
The form expands to near full-width with appropriate margins. Touch targets are large (minimum 44px) for comfortable tapping. The keyboard appears appropriately when inputs are focused.

Throughout all screen sizes, the form remains centered and focused - no distractions, just a clear path to access.

DARK MODE EXPERIENCE
--------------------
In dark mode, the login form maintains excellent readability with appropriate contrast. The sky blue login button adapts to a lighter variant for better visibility. The form background uses dark slate that's comfortable for viewing.

The overall feeling is modern and secure - users can authenticate comfortably in any lighting condition.

The page uses the same centered layout as the login screen for consistency. The background maintains the same subtle treatment - sky blue gradient or clean background that feels professional.

The registration form appears centered, elevated with subtle shadow, feeling like a card that's welcoming new members. The form has generous spacing and feels approachable - not intimidating despite collecting personal information.

WELCOME MESSAGE
---------------
At the top of the form, a welcoming message appears: "Crie sua conta" (Create your account) or "Comece a controlar suas finanças" (Start controlling your finances). This message feels inviting and clearly communicates the value of registration.

Below the main heading, supportive text explains benefits: "Gerencie suas transações, acompanhe suas metas e organize suas finanças de forma simples." (Manage your transactions, track your goals, and organize your finances simply.) This helps users understand what they're signing up for.

FULL NAME INPUT
---------------
The first field collects the user's full name. The label "Nome Completo" (Full Name) sits clearly above the input. The field has a user icon on the left side, providing visual context.

The placeholder text "João Silva" gives users a clear example of the expected format. The input is sized generously for typical names.

When focused, the input glows with sky blue, maintaining consistency with other forms. Real-time validation checks for minimum length and appropriate format, showing helpful error messages if invalid.

EMAIL INPUT FIELD
-----------------
The email field appears below the name field with appropriate spacing. The label "E-mail" is clear, and an email icon appears on the left side of the input.

The placeholder "seu@email.com" provides format guidance. The input uses email format validation that checks on blur and shows specific error messages: "Por favor, insira um e-mail válido" (Please enter a valid email).

The field feels important - this email will be used for account access and notifications, so it's clearly essential.

PASSWORD INPUT FIELD
--------------------
The password field uses the same styling as the login screen for consistency. The label "Senha" (Password) is clear, and a lock icon appears on the left side.

The password input is masked with dots for security. A password visibility toggle (eye icon) appears on the right side, allowing users to verify their password entry.

PASSWORD STRENGTH INDICATOR
----------------------------
Below the password field, a password strength indicator provides real-time feedback as users type:

The indicator shows a visual bar that fills and changes color based on password strength:
- Weak (0-25%): Red bar, "Fraca" (Weak) label
- Fair (25-50%): Orange/amber bar, "Regular" (Fair) label
- Good (50-75%): Yellow bar, "Boa" (Good) label
- Strong (75-100%): Green bar, "Forte" (Strong) label

The indicator updates in real-time as users type, providing immediate feedback. This helps users create secure passwords without feeling frustrated by requirements they don't understand.

Helpful text below the indicator explains requirements: "Mínimo 8 caracteres, incluindo letras e números" (Minimum 8 characters, including letters and numbers). This guidance feels helpful, not restrictive.

PASSWORD CONFIRMATION FIELD
----------------------------
Below the password field, a confirmation field appears. The label "Confirmar Senha" (Confirm Password) is clear. This field also has a lock icon and password visibility toggle.

As users type in the confirmation field, real-time validation checks if passwords match. When they match, a green checkmark appears, and the field shows a subtle green border - confirming success without being distracting.

When passwords don't match, a helpful error message appears: "As senhas não coincidem" (Passwords do not match). This happens immediately as users type, helping them catch mistakes early.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS CHECKBOX
------------------------------
Below the password fields, a checkbox appears for terms and conditions acceptance. The checkbox is required for registration.

The text reads: "Eu aceito os Termos de Uso e Política de Privacidade" (I accept the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy). The "Termos de Uso" and "Política de Privacidade" parts are links that open in a new tab or modal, allowing users to read the full documents.

The checkbox uses modern styling that matches the design system. It's clearly required - the form cannot be submitted without it checked.

REGISTER BUTTON

The button is full-width within the form for easy clicking on all devices. It has generous padding and rounded corners.

When clicked, validation runs on all fields. If valid, the button shows a loading state with spinner and "Criando conta..." (Creating account...) text. The button becomes disabled during registration to prevent multiple submissions.

If registration succeeds, a success message appears, and users are redirected to the dashboard (or email verification screen if email verification is required). If registration fails, error messages appear at the top of the form.

ERROR HANDLING
--------------
When registration fails, error messages appear helpfully:

- General errors appear at the top of the form in a red-bordered box
- Field-level errors appear below relevant fields with specific guidance
- Email already exists: "Este e-mail já está cadastrado" (This email is already registered)
- Weak password: "A senha não atende aos requisitos de segurança" (Password does not meet security requirements)
- Terms not accepted: "Você deve aceitar os termos de uso" (You must accept the terms of use)

All error messages are in Portuguese and feel helpful - they guide users toward successful registration rather than just pointing out problems.

-------------
During registration, the form shows clear loading feedback:

1. The register button shows spinner and "Criando conta..." text

At the bottom of the form, a login link appears: "Já tem uma conta? Entrar" (Already have an account? Sign in). This link uses subtle styling that matches the login screen.

================================================================================
SCREEN 9: PASSWORD RECOVERY SCREEN
================================================================================

USER EXPERIENCE VISION
----------------------
This screen helps users regain access to their accounts when they've forgotten their password. It should feel supportive and straightforward - not like a barrier, but like a helpful tool for account recovery. When users arrive here, they should feel confident that recovering their password is simple and secure.

The screen is minimal and focused - it does one thing well: helps users request a password reset link. There's no unnecessary complexity, just a clear path to account recovery.

VISUAL HIERARCHY - WHAT USERS NOTICE FIRST
-------------------------------------------
1. Recovery heading - explains what this screen does
2. Email input field - where users enter their account email
3. Send reset link button - clear action

RECOVERY HEADING
----------------
At the top of the form, a clear heading appears: "Recuperar Senha" (Recover Password) or "Esqueceu sua senha?" (Forgot your password?). This heading immediately establishes what this screen does.

Below the heading, supportive text explains the process: "Digite seu e-mail e enviaremos um link para redefinir sua senha." (Enter your email and we'll send a link to reset your password.) This text feels helpful and explains the next steps clearly.

EMAIL INPUT FIELD
-----------------
The email field is the only input on this screen, so it deserves prominence. The label "E-mail" sits clearly above the input. An email icon appears on the left side for visual context.

The placeholder "seu@email.com" provides format guidance. The input is sized generously and uses the same sky blue focus glow as other forms for consistency.

Email format validation checks on blur and shows helpful error messages if invalid. The field feels important - this is how users will receive their reset link.

SEND RESET LINK BUTTON

The primary action button "Enviar Link de Redefinição" (Send Reset Link) appears prominently below the email field. It uses sky blue background with white text, maintaining brand consistency.

The button is full-width within the form for easy clicking. When clicked, validation runs on the email field. If valid, the button shows a loading state with spinner and "Enviando..." (Sending...) text.

The button becomes disabled during the request to prevent multiple submissions.

SUCCESS STATE
-------------
After successfully submitting the recovery request, the form transforms into a success state:

The email input and button are replaced with a success message:
- A checkmark icon in green
- Heading: "E-mail enviado!" (Email sent!)
- Message: "Enviamos um link de redefinição para [email]. Por favor, verifique sua caixa de entrada e spam." (We sent a reset link to [email]. Please check your inbox and spam folder.)

This success state feels clear and helpful - users know exactly what to do next. The message acknowledges spam folders, which is thoughtful and realistic.

ERROR HANDLING
--------------
If the email doesn't exist in the system or there's an error, helpful messages appear:

- Email not found: "Este e-mail não está cadastrado" (This email is not registered)
- General error: "Erro ao enviar e-mail. Tente novamente." (Error sending email. Try again.)
- Invalid email format: "Por favor, insira um e-mail válido" (Please enter a valid email)

Error messages appear at the top of the form or below the email field, depending on the error type. They feel helpful, not frustrating.

BACK TO LOGIN LINK
-------------------
At the bottom of the form, a "Voltar para login" (Back to login) link appears. This provides easy navigation for users who remember their password or want to try logging in again.

The link uses subtle styling that doesn't compete with the main action but remains easily accessible.

HELP TEXT
----------
Below the send button, helpful text might appear: "Não recebeu o e-mail? Verifique sua caixa de spam ou tente novamente em alguns minutos." (Didn't receive the email? Check your spam folder or try again in a few minutes.)

This text feels supportive and provides actionable guidance without being overly technical.

LOADING STATE
-------------
During the request, the form shows clear loading feedback:

1. The button shows spinner and "Enviando..." text
2. The email field becomes disabled
3. The button becomes disabled
4. A subtle loading overlay might appear

This prevents multiple submissions and clearly communicates processing.

RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
--------------------
The password recovery form adapts beautifully across devices, using the same responsive patterns as other authentication screens:

Desktop: Centered form with comfortable width
Tablet: Maintains width, adjusts padding
Mobile: Near full-width with large touch targets

The form remains focused and uncluttered on all screen sizes.

DARK MODE EXPERIENCE
--------------------
In dark mode, the recovery form maintains excellent readability and contrast. The sky blue button adapts appropriately. All text and interactive elements remain clearly visible.

The overall feeling is supportive and professional - users can recover their password comfortably in any lighting condition.

SCREEN 10: USER PROFILE AND ACCOUNT SETTINGS
================================================================================

USER EXPERIENCE VISION
----------------------
This screen is where users manage their personal information, security settings, and account preferences. It should feel comprehensive yet organized - like a well-organized control panel where users can confidently manage their account. When users arrive here, they should feel in control and secure - their data, their settings, their choices.

The screen balances multiple sections without feeling overwhelming. Each section has clear purpose and boundaries, making it easy for users to find what they need and make changes confidently.

VISUAL HIERARCHY - WHAT USERS NOTICE FIRST
-------------------------------------------
1. Profile header with avatar and name - personal identification
2. Personal Information section - basic account details
3. Security section - password and session management
4. Preferences section - language and display settings
5. Data Management section - export and account deletion

The eye flows naturally: profile → personal info → security → preferences → data management

PAGE LAYOUT STRUCTURE
---------------------
The page uses a clean, sectioned layout. The profile header appears at the top, establishing user identity. Below that, sections are organized in cards or well-defined areas with clear visual separation.

Each section feels complete and independent - users can focus on one area at a time without distraction. Spacing between sections provides breathing room and clear organization.

PROFILE HEADER - PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION
-----------------------------------------
At the top of the page, a profile header establishes user identity:

Avatar Display:
A circular avatar shows the user's profile picture or initials. The avatar is large enough to feel personal (maybe 80-100px diameter) and has a sky blue border that ties it to the brand. If no picture is set, initials appear in a colored circle.

Name Display:
The user's full name appears prominently below or beside the avatar. It uses a comfortable, readable font size that feels personal but professional.

Email Display:
The user's email appears below the name in a smaller, softer gray font. This confirms account identity without drawing too much attention.

Edit Profile Button:
A sky blue button "Editar Perfil" (Edit Profile) appears in the header area, providing quick access to profile editing. This button feels accessible but not overwhelming.

PERSONAL INFORMATION SECTION
-----------------------------
This section contains basic account information that users can view and edit:

Section Header:
A clear heading "Informações Pessoais" (Personal Information) establishes this section's purpose. A subtle border or background separates it visually from other sections.

Full Name Display and Edit:
The full name appears with a label "Nome Completo" (Full Name). An "Alterar" (Change) button appears next to it. When clicked, an inline edit form or modal appears, allowing users to update their name.

The edit form uses the same styling as other forms - sky blue focus states, clear labels, helpful validation. When saved, a success message appears: "Nome atualizado com sucesso!" (Name updated successfully!)

Email Display:
The email address appears with a label "E-mail" and shows the current email. An "Alterar" (Change) button appears, though email changes might require additional verification for security.

Date of Birth (if collected):
If the system collects date of birth, it appears here with appropriate formatting and edit capability.

Profile Picture Upload:
An option to upload or change profile picture appears. Users can click to select an image file. A preview appears showing how the new picture will look. When uploaded, the avatar updates immediately, providing instant feedback.

All fields in this section feel editable and approachable - users can confidently update their personal information.

SECURITY SECTION - ACCOUNT PROTECTION
-------------------------------------
This section manages account security:

Section Header:
A clear heading "Segurança" (Security) with a lock icon establishes this section's importance. Visual separation makes it distinct from other sections.

Change Password:
A password change form appears within this section or opens in a modal when "Alterar Senha" (Change Password) is clicked:

- Current Password field - required for security
- New Password field - with password strength indicator
- Confirm New Password field - with matching validation
- Update button - saves the new password

The form uses the same password strength indicator as registration, providing consistent feedback. When saved successfully, a clear success message appears: "Senha alterada com sucesso!" (Password changed successfully!)

Session Management:
A list of active sessions appears, showing:
- Device type and browser
- Location (if available)
- Last activity time
- "Terminar Sessão" (End Session) button for each

The current session is highlighted or marked "Sessão Atual" (Current Session) so users understand which device they're using. Ending other sessions feels secure but not aggressive - users control their account access.

Two-Factor Authentication (if available):
If 2FA is supported, an option to enable/disable it appears with clear explanations of benefits. A toggle switch manages the state, with sky blue when enabled.

PREFERENCES SECTION - USER CUSTOMIZATION
----------------------------------------
This section lets users customize their experience:

Section Header:
A heading "Preferências" (Preferences) with a settings icon establishes this section.

Language Selection:
A dropdown lets users select their preferred language: "Português (Brasil)" (Portuguese - Brazil), "English", etc. The current selection is clearly highlighted. When changed, the interface updates immediately or requires a page refresh with appropriate messaging.

Date Format Selection:
A dropdown lets users choose date format preferences: "DD/MM/YYYY", "MM/DD/YYYY", etc. Brazilian users likely prefer DD/MM/YYYY, so it's the default.

Currency Display:
If multiple currencies are supported, users can set their preferred currency display. For Brazilian users, "Real (BRL)" is the default and primary option.

Notifications Preferences:
Toggles or checkboxes let users control notification types:
- Email notifications for transactions
- Goal progress updates
- Market data alerts
- System announcements

Each preference has clear labels explaining what it controls. Toggles use sky blue when enabled, maintaining visual consistency.

Export Options:
Multiple export buttons appear:

- "Exportar Metas" (Export Goals) - CSV format

Each button uses sky blue styling and shows a loading state when clicked. After export, a success message appears: "Dados exportados com sucesso!" (Data exported successfully!) with download information.

The export process feels straightforward - users can confidently download their data.

A "Excluir Conta" (Delete Account) button appears with red/danger styling to signal its significance. When clicked, a confirmation modal appears with:

- Clear warning: "Esta ação não pode ser desfeita" (This action cannot be undone)
- Explanation of what will be deleted
- Final confirmation field requiring user to type "DELETAR" or account email
- Cancel and Confirm buttons

The confirmation process feels secure - users must intentionally confirm this destructive action. The red styling signals importance without being alarming.

SAVE AND CANCEL ACTIONS
-----------------------
Throughout the profile page, save and cancel buttons appear contextually:

- Section-level saves for individual sections
- Page-level save for multiple changes
- Cancel buttons reset changes within sections

All save buttons use sky blue styling. Cancel buttons use subtle gray styling. Loading states show during save operations, and success messages confirm successful updates.

RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
--------------------
The profile page adapts beautifully across devices:

Desktop (>1024px):
All sections are visible in a single column with comfortable spacing. The layout feels organized and comprehensive.

Tablet (768px-1024px):
Sections remain in single column but may stack more compactly. Touch targets remain appropriately sized.

Mobile (<768px):
Sections stack vertically with clear separation. Each section feels complete on its own. Touch targets are large (minimum 44px) for comfortable interaction.

================================================================================
SCREEN 11: TRANSACTION CATEGORIES MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

USER EXPERIENCE VISION
----------------------
This screen helps users organize their financial transactions through a flexible category system. It should feel logical and manageable - like organizing a filing cabinet where categories make sense and are easy to maintain. When users arrive here, they should feel empowered to create a categorization system that works for their financial life.

The screen uses a two-panel layout that clearly shows the hierarchy: main categories on the left, subcategories on the right. This structure makes the relationship between categories and subcategories obvious and intuitive.

VISUAL HIERARCHY - WHAT USERS NOTICE FIRST
-------------------------------------------
1. Main categories list (left panel) - primary organization
2. Selected category highlight - shows active context
3. Subcategories list (right panel) - secondary organization
4. Add buttons - clear paths to creating new categories
5. Category counts - shows usage and importance

The eye flows naturally: categories → selection → subcategories → actions

PAGE LAYOUT STRUCTURE
---------------------
The page uses a two-panel layout that clearly separates main categories from subcategories:

Left Panel (Main Categories):
This panel takes about 40% of the screen width on desktop. It displays all main transaction categories in a scrollable list. Each category shows its name, transaction count, and subcategory count.

Right Panel (Subcategories):
This panel takes about 60% of the screen width. It displays subcategories for the selected main category. When no category is selected, it shows an empty state or placeholder.

The panels are clearly separated by a vertical divider, making the relationship obvious. On mobile, the panels stack vertically, with categories on top and subcategories below.

LEFT PANEL - MAIN CATEGORIES
-----------------------------
The left panel displays all main transaction categories:

Panel Header:
A clear header "Categorias Principais" (Main Categories) establishes this panel's purpose. An "Adicionar Categoria" (Add Category) button appears in the header, providing clear access to category creation.

Category List:
Each category appears as a card or list item with:

Category Name:
The category name appears prominently - this is the primary identifier. Names like "Alimentação" (Food), "Transporte" (Transportation), "Moradia" (Housing) are clear and familiar.

Transaction Count:
A count badge shows how many transactions use this category: "125 transações" (125 transactions). This number helps users understand category importance and usage. The badge uses a subtle gray background that doesn't compete with the category name.

Subcategory Count:
A count shows how many subcategories exist: "8 subcategorias" (8 subcategories). This helps users understand category complexity. The count appears near the transaction count for easy scanning.

Selection State:
When a category is selected, it highlights with a sky blue background or left border. The selection feels obvious but not overwhelming. Selected category names might appear in sky blue text or with increased font weight.

Actions:
Each category has action buttons that appear on hover (desktop) or are always visible (mobile):
- Edit icon - opens edit form
- Delete icon - removes category (with confirmation)

The actions feel accessible but not intrusive - users can manage categories easily.

Empty State:
When no categories exist, the left panel shows a friendly empty state:
- A large icon (folder or category icon)
- Heading: "Nenhuma categoria criada" (No categories created)
- Message: "Crie sua primeira categoria para organizar suas transações." (Create your first category to organize your transactions.)
- "Criar Categoria" button - prominent sky blue call-to-action

RIGHT PANEL - SUBCATEGORIES
---------------------------
The right panel displays subcategories for the selected main category:

Panel Header:
A header shows the selected category name: "Subcategorias: Alimentação" (Subcategories: Food). This immediately establishes context. An "Adicionar Subcategoria" (Add Subcategory) button appears, but it's disabled or hidden when no category is selected.

Subcategory Table:
Subcategories appear in a table format with columns:

- Nome (Name) - the subcategory name
- Status - Active/Inactive badge
- Uso - number of transactions using this subcategory
- Ações (Actions) - Edit and Delete buttons

The table feels organized and scannable. Status badges use color coding: green for Active, gray for Inactive.

Sorting:
A sort option might appear: "Ordenar por uso" (Sort by usage) toggle that sorts subcategories by transaction count, helping users identify most-used subcategories.

Empty State:
When no category is selected, the right panel shows:
- A centered icon or illustration
- Message: "Selecione uma categoria para ver suas subcategorias" (Select a category to view its subcategories)

When a category is selected but has no subcategories:
- Icon showing empty state
- Heading: "Nenhuma subcategoria" (No subcategories)
- Message: "Esta categoria ainda não tem subcategorias. Adicione uma para organizar melhor." (This category doesn't have subcategories yet. Add one to organize better.)
- "Adicionar Subcategoria" button - prominent call-to-action

ADD/EDIT CATEGORY FORM
---------------------
When users click "Adicionar Categoria" or edit an existing category, a modal or inline form appears:

Form Fields:
- Category Name input - required, with validation
- Description textarea (optional) - helps users remember category purpose
- Color picker (optional) - lets users assign colors for visual organization
- Save and Cancel buttons

The form uses the same styling as other forms - sky blue focus states, clear labels, helpful validation. When saved, a success message appears, and the category list updates immediately.

ADD/EDIT SUBCATEGORY FORM
-------------------------
When users click "Adicionar Subcategoria" or edit a subcategory, a similar form appears:

Form Fields:
- Subcategory Name input - required
- Status toggle - Active/Inactive
- Save and Cancel buttons

The form feels focused - subcategories are simpler than main categories, so the form reflects that simplicity.

DELETE CONFIRMATION
--------------------
When users attempt to delete a category or subcategory, a confirmation dialog appears:

For categories with transactions:
- Warning: "Esta categoria possui [X] transações. Ao excluir, essas transações ficarão sem categoria. Deseja continuar?" (This category has [X] transactions. When deleted, these transactions will be uncategorized. Do you want to continue?)

For categories with subcategories:
- Warning: "Esta categoria possui [X] subcategorias que também serão excluídas. Deseja continuar?" (This category has [X] subcategories that will also be deleted. Do you want to continue?)

For empty categories:
- Confirmation: "Tem certeza que deseja excluir esta categoria?" (Are you sure you want to delete this category?)

The confirmation uses red/danger styling for delete actions, signaling significance. Users must click "Confirmar" (Confirm) to proceed, or "Cancelar" (Cancel) to abort.

LOADING STATES
--------------
When categories or subcategories are loading, skeleton placeholders appear that match the final layout. When saving, loading spinners appear on relevant buttons. All operations show clear feedback.

RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
--------------------
The two-panel layout adapts beautifully:

Desktop (>1024px):
Panels sit side-by-side with clear divider. Both panels are comfortably sized for content.

Tablet (768px-1024px):
Panels might stack vertically or maintain side-by-side with adjusted widths. The layout remains functional and clear.

Mobile (<768px):
Panels stack vertically. The categories panel appears first, then subcategories below. The selection state remains clear, and navigation between panels feels natural.

DARK MODE EXPERIENCE
--------------------
In dark mode, both panels maintain excellent readability. The sky blue selection highlights adapt appropriately. The overall feeling is organized and manageable - users can maintain their category system comfortably in any lighting condition.

The category management experience overall feels logical and empowering - users can create an organization system that truly works for their financial life.
